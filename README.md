# Formatted Report Generator

## Features
- Reads data from a CSV file (`example.csv`).
- Groups by `title` while summing up `amount` values.
- Keeps the first `date` occurrence for each title.
- Sorts records in descending order by total amount.
- Generates a properly formatted `.txt` report.

- Python 3.x installed.
